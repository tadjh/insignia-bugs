## Undocumented v1.5.4 Bugs

- Quiting crashes the game with the title screen frozen. Major bug. Soundtrack continues to play.
- Quest menu selection doesn't maintain cursor position when returning to menu.
- Infinite walk animation if scripted convo starts while walking.
- Sometimes rolls in opposite direction depending on when you buffer the roll. Might be an unintended feature.
- Some Shiny entities have a Up indicator to show they are interactable. Other Shiny entities do not. This is inconsistent.
- Intro Key caps are unlabeled if a previous save modified the key bindings.
- Changing keys bindings doesn't change the key caps. Maybe intended?
- Remove `M` is not in the key bindings menu. But is in settings menu to remove things and in game saves to remove theme.
